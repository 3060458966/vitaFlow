## Receipt OCR

### Introduction
	In this example, we show solution for extracting information from the given documents.
### Aim
	Given a receipt, the aim is to extract the domain specific fields by using deep-learning techinques.
### Steps
![](./docs/images/block-diagram.jpg)

The above diagram depicts the various 
- Dataset
    - We use the dataset present on the [website](http://expressexpense.com/view-receipts.php).
    These are the receipts collected from various sources and are of various types.
    
- Data Preparation
    - Web scrabbing : scrapy 
    - We use the python library called scrapy in order to crawl and download all the images
    - we have around ~2k receipt images.
    ![](./docs/images/ReceiptSwiss.jpg)
    
- Data Annotation
    - We annotate around 125 images using image annotation [tool](https://github.com/frederictost/images_annotation_programme). 
    - The information we are interested from the receipts are 
        - Merchant - name of the store
        - Receipt number - bill id
        - Date-  receipt issue date
        - Line items and their value - items in cart and their value
        - Total - final total value paid
        - Tax - tax calculated on line items
        - Mode of payment - card/cash
    ![](./docs/images/image-anno.png)
    
- Object Detection
    - We leverage the existing pre-trained models for the detecting the above points of interest by using [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
- Image Segmentation and Cropping
    - Following folder structure is adopted to output the images by croping the receipt image for predicted co-ordinates and labels
        ```
        image_name_1\
            label_1.jpg
            label_2.jpg
            label_3.jpg
         ...
        ```
- OCR : Tesseract. Converts the cropped images to text

        image_name_1\
            label_1.txt
            label_2.txt
            label_3.txt
        ...  
- Text Postprocessing : Domain specific 

        image_name_1.csv
        ...

### Experiment Goal
- Provide a end-to-end solution for information extraction from images.
- Achieve decent accuracy with very few annotated images.
