# VF Image Annotation Tool


Initial goal of this Annotation tool was to provide a simple annotation tool that can do the following

* A Image Annotation - Web tool (can run in local or over web for a group collaboration)
* Generation of XML-annotation file for each image file

As the growth continued, we added following image features to it.

* Fix rotation images
* Crop the image to user required size
* Automated Binarisation of images

Other pages

* A Summary page: To review how well the cropping & binarisation are working
* A Stats page: To know the statistics of on annotation completed

# History

Today, Image(document) Annotation has become of the important tool & job required for machine learning models to learn and try to predict. But as of 2019, we find only a limited number of tools that fit into out category that would help quickly annotated the image.

We have inspired from the works of `Image Annotation Programme` and wished to take forward, meeting our needs and increasing it capability by assisting users in their work.
